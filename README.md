# csee2210-ImageReader

Welcome to ImageReader!  This app was created for my CSEE 2210 class at the University of Georgia.
That probably means that you aren't allowed to copy this code, but feel free to look at it.  I
am sorry that it looks weird in GitHub's viewer, but all the indents are right if you look at this
in another program.

## What is this project?

This project was designed to help dyslexic students with improving their reading comprehension.
Using the CameraApp class, the user can take a picture using the Raspberry Pi Camera Module,
and it will be read to thrm using text-to-speech software provided by the GNUstep speech
engine.  For our project, we bundled this software into a jar file and executed it on a
Raspberry Pi 3 B+.  For a demonstration of the design, please see THIS YouTube video.

## How to Run

In order to run this project, you will need:

    1. A Raspberry Pi (preferrable one with camera support)
    2. The Raspberry Pi camera module
